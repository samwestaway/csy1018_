      <ul><li class="flexcontainer4"><br>The Web Designer job with 34education requires you to have knowledge within HTML and CSS, Adobe Products, experience in web-development and an effective understanding of the methods for good practice. This shares that similarity with the Junior CSS developer, whilst it does not require this in Web Tester. The similarities between the three are that they all require the ability to effectively communicate with others. All three jobs require you to have an understanding of how the HTML and CSS interact as the design and developer jobs will need you to actually implement the code, the tester will still need to have the understanding of how this works as when they find errors/problems they will be required to submit a formal report to the developers to allow the changes to be rectified easily.

          <br>
          The average salary for these 3 jobs is similar in the range of: £18,000 up to £25,000 depending on current experience and qualifications. As the second and third are junior jobs there is a high chance of working your way up through the business. Whereas the first job is looking for a semi-experienced applicant that will be taking a mid-level job position but could assist with developing juniors and potentially earn extra bonuses for doing so.<br><br>
