         The containers and items used in the website are made, including textbox1, TEXTBOX2, textcontainer1, textcontainer2 and flexcontainer3. They are implemented into the CSS and HTML code to create the overlaying design of the website before styling is added.

          <td>
            The header mark tag, footer and body styling are added, along with colours, border styles, fonts and sizes. This gives the styling to all the containers and items within the website so far, creating the overall design of the website in one page.

      <b>My experience with Web  Development</b>
      When starting web development I found that the lack of previous experience made it especially difficult the further along I got. At the beginning I was managing fine with the HTML side of coding, but the further along I went in the development process such as building Cascading style sheets and hamburger menus I found it to be especially difficult. This was complicated further when I had a road accident and was forced to miss a few lectures, along with the lack of actual direction we were given for the assignment. As a result of this, the assignment has been increasingly difficult for me to complete, and as I write this I still have yet to work out what I will add to my website in terms of content without it being considered incorrect.
      The assignment itself came off as very confusing for web development, with some requirements contradicting itself, such as the requirement to make a video with a group of students about how you chose your design, despite the fact the assignment is individual based and that we were told we could not work in groups.
      <br><br> Another section that confused me was the content we had to add. Whilst we had a list of pages describing what was going on what, we weren't given much in the way of assistance as to what type of information we were adding to it, such as if the terms in the glossary were meant to be in our own words or copied definitions with references. With this I ended up referencing copied definitions due to a lack of information provided. There were also issues with many of the links on the NILE site that were intended to help us with our assignment, as many of them lead to 404 error pages rather than useful content, only furthering the lack of help I needed to understand what I was writing about.
      <br><br> A difficult thing to accomplish was a successful colour scheme that worked well, something I still don't think i've accomplished, especially when trying to make everything fit together and blend nicely without there being any sharp colour changes. Another would be the hamburger, which caused me a few issues due to the transition code that had to be implemented in order for the icon to change into an X from three lines. I had to refer to a public codepen for reference to make it work properly. The only other thing I really had issues with was creating the website for mobile, tablet and desktop, as once I edited the non-query(mobile) it caused the rest of the websites layout to freak out.
      <br><br>Possibly one of the most confusing things I came across that stumped me for a long time was trying to resize the images for each media query.
      <br><br> If I were to provide feedback or do this assignment again, I'd be much more vocal with asking for help, and going to support sessions regarding the website, along with finding tutorials to further my knowledge.
