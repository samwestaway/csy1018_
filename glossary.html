      <H3>HTTP</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. Though often based on a TCP/IP layer, it can be used on any reliable transport layer; that is, a protocol that doesn't lose messages silently, such as UDP. <br><i>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP</i></p>
      <H3>HTML</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2"> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It describes and defines the content of a webpage.

      <div class = "textcontainer2">
      <H3>CANVAS API</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">The canvas element can be used to draw graphics via scripting in JavaScript.

      <H3>SVG</H3>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based markup language for describing two dimensional based  vector graphics. SVG is essentially to graphics what HTML is to text.<br><i>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG</i>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2"></p>
      <H3>WebGL API</H3>WebGL (Web Graphics Library) is a JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins.

      <H3>XML</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">XML (Extensible Markup Language) defines rules for writing other markup languages.<br><i>http://www.webdesigndictionary.com/term.php?definition=XML</i></p>
      <H3>SITEMAP</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">A document that shows a global, hierarchical view of a website’s pages and content. This is usually one of the first steps in a website redesign, as it is important to know what content is needed on a website before design begins. A site map can also be a web page that offers links to all the pages within a website.<br><i>https://www.circlesstudio.com/blog/25-web-design-development-terms-every-marketer-know/</i></p>
      <H3>ELEMENT</H3>

      <H3>FLEX</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">Flex is a new value added to the CSS display property. Along with inline-flex it causes the element that it applies to to become a flex container, and the element's children to each become a flex item. The items then participate in flex layout, and all of the properties defined in the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module may be applied.><br><i>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flex</i></p>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">A CSS grid is defined using the grid value of the display property; you can define columns and rows on your grid using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties.<br><i>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Grid</i></p>
      <H3>FONT</H3>
      <p CLASS = "TEXTBOX2">The font CSS property is either a shorthand property for setting font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-size, line-height, and font-family; or a way to set the element's font to a system font, using specific keywords.<br><i>https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font</i></p></div>
