In the first year you will study standardised modules with every computing student, giving you time to choose what specialisation you wish to embark on, such as switching to software or network engineering. It also introduces you to the university work-style that is required for exams and assignments. The modules covered over the first year consist of computer systems, computer communications, problem solving/programming and internet technologies.
      <br><br>In the second year you will begin working on the specialist pathway to focus on what you chose, in my case I will be studying computer networks, modern networks, network planning/programming and mobile computing. Within this I am also given the opportunity to work on Cisco and CCNA certificates to further my job prospects after I leave university. Upon reaching the third and fourth-postgraduate year there is an individual research project to complete.
      <br><br>The postgraduate module will expand on the technical expertise whilst also attempting to develop awareness on the business side of computing. There is also an industrial side which gives you the opportunity to further your personal qualifications, helping you to work towards becoming a Cisco certified network associate or Cisco certified network professional.  To do this you have to complete three modules and complete a dissertation.
      <br><br>So far I am rather enjoying my course, especially networking despite finding it rather challenging and complicated at first, much like computer systems as I already have a wide array of knowledge within this field. However, I cannot say the same with Web Development as it is extremely confusing for me, and I donâ€™t particularly enjoy it in the first place.
